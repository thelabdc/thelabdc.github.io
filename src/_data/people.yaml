    Rebecca's research studies how social service bureaucracies prioritize amidst limited resources. Her dissertation research examines prioritization in school districts. It shows how districts facing budget pressure use discretion to decide that fewer students fall into prioritized categories and uses computational text analysis of legal cases to show how parents reduce this discretion. Her newer research studies and aids government agencies in using large-scale data and predictive modeling for more equitable prioritization. As a 2018 Summer Fellow with Data Science for Social Good, she and team members collaborated with the NYC Mayor's Public Engagement Unit to develop a predictive model to prioritize outreach to rental tenants at risk of landlord harassment.

    She holds her PhD in Sociology, Social Policy, and Demography at Princeton University, where she was a Graduate Prize Fellow with the Center for Human Values. Before arriving at Princeton, Rebecca received a B.A. in psychology and M.A. focused on political theory from Stanford, and spent two years as a pre-doctoral fellow at the National Institutes of Health's (NIH) Department of Bioethics.

    with their partner and (since much more recently!) with their kid. When not at
    work, Ren can be found running or practicing yoga or walking endlessly (especially
    on mountainsides); watching movies filmed decades ago in grainy black-and-white
    and with subtitles; reading “serious” and “genre” fiction, and history, politics,

    statistics as hobbies; and mastering role-playing game systems they will never

    live on Mars, or be fully Bayesian while living on Mars.\n"

  bio: |
    Ryan is a Civic Design Researcher at The Lab @ DC. He is working with residents and government agencies to assure that DC’s federal recovery funds have the greatest possible impact on the wellbeing of District residents.

    Before joining The Lab in 2021, Ryan worked in operational and research roles at the World Bank and on policy evaluation and advocacy in the non-profit and private sectors. He has mobilized business advocacy for more equitable K-12 funding in Massachusetts, helped an East African government co-create a national plan for post-secondary educational investment, and consulted for public agencies in Southeast Asia seeking to close strategic skills gaps. The common thread through this work is a commitment to working with governments to set clear goals and treat residents as partners in designing and evaluating public investments. Ryan holds degrees from the London School of Economics and Villanova University.

    Excited by novelty and averse to hobby commitment, Ryan has never been known for his pastime prowess. He excels at becoming just okay at a variety of activities and is excited about his current slate: candle making, sailboat racing, and tango. But he also just learned how to knit… Ryan lives in Ward 6 with his wife.
