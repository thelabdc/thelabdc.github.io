  bio: "Paul Testa is a senior social scientist in the Lab @ D.C. He is also an assistant
    professor of political science at Brown University where he teaches courses on
    quantitative research methods at the graduate and undergraduate level.\n\nPaul's
    research interests center around the applications of political methodology to
    the studies of race and the criminal justice system. Broadly, his work explores
    how interactions with the criminal justice system shape political behavior and
    how these experiences in turn shape the way citizens think about issues of race
    and justice in the U.S. His work has appeared in the American Journal of Political
    Science, the Journal of Politics, and Political Research Quarterly. He chaired
    the statistics subcommittee of a task force convened by the City of Urbana in
    Illinois to examine racial disparities in traffic stops and has previously consulted
    with Office of Evaluation Sciences in the U.S. General Services Administration
    on the evaluation of a number of randomized controlled trials within the federal
    government. \n\nPaul earned a B.A. in government and economics from Cornell University
    and a Ph.D. in Political Science from the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign.
    Born in D.C., Paul last lived in Ward 6 before heading off to graduate school.
    He's run two marathons, very slowly, through D.C. and recommends declining the
    beer offered to you at mile 22."
